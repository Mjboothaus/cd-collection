`CD-Collection` is a simple web app, built using the [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io) framework, which is a catalogue of the majority of our CDs (since recycled) providing an easy way to remember them, look them up and interact with the music via the Apple Music service.

### Background

I recycled a bunch physical CD media in March 2023 and thought I'd create an app as a record of these CDs.

### What's a CD? :)
